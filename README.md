# climex

A package to synthetically extend climate data from a netcdf template. The main motivation behind this is to create climate data to use in a spindown scenario for LPJ-GUESS. 

**DISCLAIMER**
Currently set up to work for a very specific use case so some values are hard-coded. Future iterations will create flexibility in regards to temporal resolution of the input data (daily or monthly) and the number of years from the input data to sample from.
